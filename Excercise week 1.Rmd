```


## Exercise Description

Create an HTML document that samples 100 values from a log-normal
distribution (say, mu=1, sigma=.25); create a histogram of the
distribution and the distribution on the log scale; report the mean and
variance of the sample in line in the text.

### Here we go..

## Sample Generation

```{r}
rlnorm(100, mean=1, sd= 0.25)

samp <- rlnorm(100, mean=1, sd= 0.25)
```


## Plots

```{r}
plot(samp)

hist(samp, breaks=20, xlab= "Value",  main= "Distribution", col =  "darkblue")

hist(log(samp), breaks=20, xlab= "Value", main= "Distribution on log scale" , col = "lightgreen")
```

## Discussion

The mean of the sample is `r mean(samp)` and the variance is `r var (samp)`.
